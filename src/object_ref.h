// A UObject reference that is safe to keep past the tick it was read on.
//
// A raw UObject* held across ticks can dangle. The object may be garbage
// collected (world travel, an actor or component destroyed) and its memory
// handed to a new object, and writing through the old pointer then corrupts
// whatever lives there now. try/catch does not catch that.
//
// ObjectRef keeps the object's GObjects slot and class next to the pointer.
// Get() hands the pointer back only while that slot still holds the same
// object, of the same class, that has not been marked as garbage or started
// destroying. The slot table's chunks are never freed, so reading the slot is
// safe even after the object is gone, and the object itself is only touched
// once the slot says it is still there.
//
// Why not the SDK's FWeakObjectPtr: its Get() looks up ObjectIndex alone and
// never compares ObjectSerialNumber, so it returns whatever object has taken
// that slot since. A serial check would also need a serial to compare, and
// the engine only assigns one to an object the first time something takes a
// real weak pointer to it; most components never get one.
//
// Game thread only. The engine frees these objects on the game thread, so a
// Get() there can't race the free.
