// Generic named-preset storage for a plugin's own tunable settings, backed
// by one INI file next to the plugin's other config (e.g. Plugins\config\
// BetterDrone-Presets.ini). One section per preset, named "<group>:<name>",
// so several independent groups of fields can share a single file --
// BetterDrone has "Speed" and "Range"; BetterCheats will have "Movement"
// and one group per weapon type.
//
// Pure data: no UObject/SDK access of any kind, and no per-frame file I/O
// -- Init reads the whole file into memory once, and every other call works
// off that in-memory copy; only Save/Rename/Delete write back to disk, and
// each does a single full-file rewrite (presets files are small; this is
// simpler and safer than patching sections in place).
//
// This store has no notion of "built-in" presets -- it only ever holds what
// a caller explicitly Saves. Refusing to Save/Rename/Delete onto a built-in
// preset's name is the caller's job, since only the caller knows what its
// built-ins are called.
//
// Not internally synchronized: call every function from one thread only.
// Both BetterDrone and BetterCheats drive this purely from UI interaction
// (dropdown/button clicks), so every call here happens on the ImGui render
// thread (the same thread PluginPanelDesc::renderFn runs on) -- never from
// the game tick, and never concurrently with itself.
//
// Shared verbatim between BetterDrone and BetterCheats: this pair of files
// (preset_store.h/.cpp) is meant to be copied as-is into a new plugin, with
// only the enclosing namespace renamed to match and the caller supplying
// its own group names and Field sets. Nothing plugin-specific belongs here.
